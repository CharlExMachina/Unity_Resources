## Unity Inside
* [How weights of 2D Blending are calculated](https://answers.unity.com/questions/1206428/how-weights-of-2d-blending-are-calculated.html) - This is how the mecanim blend tree works.  It's a little complicated.  You can find the research on it [here](http://runevision.com/thesis/rune_skovbo_johansen_thesis.pdf) in chapter 6.3 if you really want to.  Again, this is complicated.
